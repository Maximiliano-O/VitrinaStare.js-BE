# StArE.js Platform (Back-end)

## Description
This is the server-side for the StArE.js Platform. (Express.js with a MongoDB connection)

## Installation
To run locally:
First, you must create your own <code>.env</code> file.
For the MongoDB connection you must define the MONGODB_URI in the <code>.env</code> file. For example "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/stare". In this case "stare" would be the name of the database.
